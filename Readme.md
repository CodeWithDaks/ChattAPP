# Web Socket :-
WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing a simultaneous two-way communication channel over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011.

# Socket.IO :- npm install socket.io
. It was developed to use open connections to facilitate realtime communication, still a relatively new phenomenon at the time. Socket.IO allows bi-directional communication between client and server.

. Socket.IO is a fully featured messaging library, whereas WebSocket works at a much lower level and requires that you implement more of the functionality yourself.
